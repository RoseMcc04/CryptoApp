# CryptoApp

## Introduction

My name is Rose McCormack, and I am creating this application based off of the University of London's [*Object Oriented Programming in C++*](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming-s12n) specialization on Coursera. I am really enjoying coding in lower-level languages and hope to eventually learn C and x86 Assembly on my own, along with some minor shell scripting.
